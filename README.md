🌟 About This Repository

This repository contains all the projects I’m building as I learn web development step by step. I started with HTML and CSS and am now diving deeper into JavaScript fundamentals by building small, fun, and logic-based projects.

I’ve also created a fully responsive JavaScript portfolio website using advanced HTML and CSS concepts to showcase my work.

Become a Full-Stack Developer with AI/ML skills by age 18 and build impactful, real-world applications.
